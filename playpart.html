<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="bracket" >[Looking for his hat.] </p>
<p>Oh--then I won't detain you--</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p>No, but listen--will you not do me the favour of joining us?</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="bracket" >[Curtly and decidedly.] </p>
<p>No, I can't--thank you very much.</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p>Oh, nonsense--do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I assure
you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed--as Mrs. Tesman says.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p>I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless--</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p>And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman
at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.</p>


<h4 class="tesman" >TESMAN.</h4>

<p>Yes, think of that, Eilert,--why shouldn't you? Eh?</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="bracket" >[Interposing.] </p>
<p>But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I
am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper
with me.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="bracket" >[Looking at her.] </p>
<p>With you, Mrs. Tesman?</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p>And with Mrs. Elvsted.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p>Ah-- </p>
<p class="bracket" >[Lightly.] </p>
<p>I saw her for a moment this morning.</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p>Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost
bound to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p>That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman--in that case I will remain.</p>
