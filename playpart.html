    <h1>Chiranjeevi acts in a play</h1>
    <h3 class="name" >Play - Hedda Gabler Act 2 Author - Henrik Ibsen </h3>
    
        <p>
<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="direction" >[Looking for his hat.] </p>
<p class="speech">Oh--then I won't detain you--</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p class="speech">No, but listen--will you not do me the favour of joining us?</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="direction" >[Curtly and decidedly.] </p>
<p class="speech">No, I can't--thank you very much.</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p class="speech">Oh, nonsense--do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I assure
you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed--as Mrs. Tesman says.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="speech">I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless--</p>


<h4 class="brack" >BRACK.</h4>

<p class="speech">And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman
at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.</p>


<h4 class="tesman" >TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">Yes, think of that, Eilert,--why shouldn't you? Eh?</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="direction" >[Interposing.] </p>
<p class="speech">But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I
am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper
with me.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="direction" >[Looking at her.] </p>
<p class="speech">With you, Mrs. Tesman?</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">And with Mrs. Elvsted.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="speech">Ah-- </p>
<p class="direction" >[Lightly.] </p>
<p class="speech">I saw her for a moment this morning.</p>


<h4 class="hedda" >HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost
bound to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.</p>


<h4 class="lovborg" >LOVBORG.</h4>

<p class="speech">That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman--in that case I will remain.</p>
