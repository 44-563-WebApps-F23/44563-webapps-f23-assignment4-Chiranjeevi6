LOVBORG.

[Looking for his hat.] Oh--then I won't detain you--


BRACK.

No, but listen--will you not do me the favour of joining us?


LOVBORG.

[Curtly and decidedly.] No, I can't--thank you very much.


BRACK.

Oh, nonsense--do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I assure
you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed--as Mrs. Tesman says.


LOVBORG.

I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless--


BRACK.

And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman
at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.


TESMAN.

Yes, think of that, Eilert,--why shouldn't you? Eh?


HEDDA.

[Interposing.] But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I
am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper
with me.


LOVBORG.

[Looking at her.] With you, Mrs. Tesman?


HEDDA.

And with Mrs. Elvsted.


LOVBORG.

Ah-- [Lightly.] I saw her for a moment this morning.


HEDDA.

Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost
bound to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.


LOVBORG.

That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman--in that case I will remain.
